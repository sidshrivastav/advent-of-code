# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in Go

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges implemented in the Go programming language.

## Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that takes place in December. It consists of daily coding challenges with two parts released each day.

## Structure

Each day's solution is organized in its own directory named `day-XX`, where `XX` represents the day of the challenge. Inside each day's directory, you'll find the Go source code (`main.go`) for the solutions and any additional files necessary for the solution.

## How to Run

To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
